    "description":"Hey all! I am a 23 year old girl from the Canadian prairies. I am the captain and backline for the West Broadway Grillers since December 2018 when the comp team was formed. The Grillers clan however, did originate a year earlier when me and my local friends were just casual players at the time. I've taken 3 years of college to work my way into Journalism. While I wait to get accepted into the main course, I am taking an Office Administration course. Another thing about me is that I name my main weapons. For example Steve (Heavy Splatling) & Hugo (Hydra).",
