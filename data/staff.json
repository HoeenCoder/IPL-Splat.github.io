I've been playing Splatoon since it was on the Wii U and have been on many teams. Aside from Splatoon, I do enjoy playing other games for the Nintendo Switch, like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.I'm a big animal lover (so show me your pet pics!) and I've been playing music for some time now, I mostly play Piano and Kalimba. I'm always open to chat and meeting new Splatoon peeps any time so don't be afraid to shoot me a DM  \\o/",

While I wait to get accepted into the main course, I am taking an Office Administration course. Another thing about me is that I name my main weapons.
